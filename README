Mood Collector

This is a python script that uses the 
Twitter Search API (http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/search) to find tweets that
contain info about someone's mood (sad, happy, ...). With the list of tweets, it
finds the ones that contain lat, lon coordinates, and stores them in a SimpleGeo
layer (http://simplegeo.com/).

To install and run this on your own, there are a few dependencies

1) First you'll need Python installed, preferably 2.6

2) This script uses the cool tools written 
   by SimpleGeo (http://github.com/simplegeo/python-simplegeo) install them
   and the dependencies

3) You'll need a SimpleGeo api key, and layer (http://simplegeo.com/signup/)
   They will assign you a key, update const.py with your oauth info
   
4) then just run it using

   python mood.py

This is just a fun experiment, will likely update it with more moods, and better
language processing.
