{"name":"Moodcollector","body":"### Description or Usage\r\nWelcome To the GitHub Automatic Page Generator. Here are few recommended sections to help you get started. Some of our templates may include graphic icons to accompany these specific h3 headlines. There are two ways to take advantage of this feature. If you’d like to  include icons automatically, simply include these section keywords in the headings. For instance, creating a heading with the content “Contact” or “Get In Contact” will add a `class=”contact”` to the HTML and the associated icons will be visible. If you prefer to drive manual or want to use different heading titles, you can edit your HTML and add the classes to the `<h3>` element. The heading keywords and classes are:\r\n\r\n### Authors or Contributors\r\nYou can add authors here by @mentioning their github username. The resulting `<a>` tag will link to authors’ GitHub Profile.\r\nFor example: In 2006, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjheyett), and Tom-Preston Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble using Pages? Contact support@github.com and we’ll get you sorted.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nIn Pages, batteries are included. You only need a GitHub account and a repo to publish a site. Nothing to install, nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nAre there more pieces to the puzzle? You could list them and provide links to their repositories in this section.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nSince this Project Page will be a simple, forward-facing site, why not provide an easy link to download your project files as a .TAR or .ZIP?\r\n\r\nIf you’re curious of the results or just want to check out the templates, go ahead and continue to layouts to see a preview. You can easily come back here to edit your page. If you need to see the list after you’ve started editing this text, press the “h” key while your mouse is not in a text field to reveal the list of keywords or visit the Pages documentation.\r\n\r\n","google":"","tagline":"This is a python script that uses the Twitter Search API to find tweets that contain info about someone's mood (sad, happy, ...).
